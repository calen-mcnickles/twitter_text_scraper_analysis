### Scrape Twitter, Clean Tweets, Analyze results
Calen McNickles

1. Scrape most recent designated number of tweets and export them to sqlite db - recommended for larger scrapes. You can also use the scraped tweet df directly with the rest of the notebook, otherwise export the df directly to a csv - recommended for smaller scrapes.
2. Clean all of the tweets text and get the df down to individual words and their count.
3. Scrape specified number of coin names and tickers from coingecko.com.
4. Count only occruences of coin names and tickers within the scraped tweets.
